    <p class="p1">Legacy University Okija soars higher, emerges first position in 2021 Nigerian University system ranking</p><br>
    <p>May 12, 2022</p>
    <img src="https://legacyuniversity.edu.ng/News-img/ranking.jpg" width="100%"><br>
    <span>Five years old Legacy University Okija has continued to add to her feathers as the University emerged first position in South East Zone ranking by student - Teacher ratio conducted by National University Commission (NUC) for the year 2021. The ranking result also disclosed that the said University in the same zone took the first position in ranking by international students and as well came second in South East zone of Nigeria in ranking by academic efficiency.

        Reacting to the development, the Pro-Chancellor of the University Dr. Leonard Nkameme said he was not surprised about the huge success the University recorded at the just concluded University ranking by NUC since the management is not leaving any stone unturned to ensure the University grows in leaps and bounds physically, academically, morally and otherwise. He posited that the school is the fastest growing private university in Nigeria with accreditation in all the courses being offered.
        
        According to him, Legacy University is now a world class University which has been granted her permanent statutory license by NUC to operate as a full fledged University after three years and has gotten full accreditation in all her programmes in 2019, asserting that the above achievement is the first of its kind in the annals of private Universities in Nigeria. He made it clear that Legacy University Okija has continued to focus on her pursuit for excellency in teaching, cutting edge research and service to the society.
        
        The Pro-Chancellor further noted that the University has a serene environment architecturally designed for serious academic activities. His words; "the University is replete with qualified and proficient staff that are creative and productive in line with the required standard of NUC bench mark" Without mincing words, the University is blessed with state of the art facilities such as free internet network access around the campus with well equipped laboratories for practicals and modern library with current textbooks. Our partnership with the ICT University and Louisiana University USA have been further strengthened through the introduction of more areas of collaboration especially in the world of ICT.
        
        Today we have e-library / ICT center with thousands of e-books which students can access free of charge. In other words, Legacy University Okija position in the Just concluded University ranking is a testimony of the giant strides the University has been able to achieve within few years of existence. In addition to this, the University has successfully graduated two set of students. The first set is concluding their NYSC programme while the second set is currently serving their father land under NYSC scheme.
        
        Also, the Vice Chancellor of the University Prof Ezekiel Ihionu in his contribution said the ranking depicted the true picture of litany of success the University is recording daily. According to him, Legacy University by the achievement far attained, has the capacity for rapid development. It will interest you to know that back in September 2001, Nigeria through the National University Commission ( NUC), initiated steps towards a national ranking of its Universities. This turned out to be the first of such ranking in Africa. There were three major drivers for this effort.
        
        The first was a desire among the population to know more about the relative standing (performance) of the Universities and their programmes in order to guide career choices by prospective students. Secondly, the government wanted a transparent and objective mechanism for identifying centers of excellence to which fund/ allocation could be preferentially applied. Thirdly, the NUC whose mandate include the orderly development of the Universities needed a basis for advising government on programmes that should be strengthened to address projected human resources needs of the country.
